# Quest Characters with Inheritance

This starter project pairs with the **Quest Characters with Inheritance** card in the Student Practice plug-in.

## Student TODOs
- Review the base `Character` class in `src/com/school/student/characters`.
- Implement subclasses like `Mage` or `Warrior` and give them special abilities.
- Flesh out the polymorphism tests in `test/com/school/student/characters`.

## Teacher Notes
- `CharacterPolymorphismTest` starts with a simple scenarioâ€”extend it for your grading rubric.
- Update the plug-in repository with new starter file paths if you move or rename classes.
- The Google Classroom integration expects the zipped project folder as the submission artifact.
