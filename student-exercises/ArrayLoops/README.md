# Looping Through Arrays

This starter project pairs with the **Looping Through Arrays** card in the Student Practice plug-in.

## Student TODOs
- Implement the missing loop logic in `src/com/school/student/ArrayStats.java`.
- Fill in the aggregate methods so every test in `ArrayStatsTestSuite` passes.
- Use the provided parameterized tests as examples when adding new scenarios.

## Teacher Notes
- `ArrayStatsTestSuite` aggregates two test classesâ€”add more to expand coverage.
- Update the plug-in's `ExerciseRepository` class if you change the suite or starter file names.
- Consider cloning this project when creating variations for advanced sections.
